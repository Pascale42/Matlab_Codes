% Multitaper coherence density
% This basically does the same thing as mtcsd, but scales
% the cross-spectra to become coherences
% also computes phase lag phi , which like the following:
% phi(:,1,2)=  phase(x2) - phase(x1)
% so positive sign means x1 is leading x2 (shifted to the left from x2)
% if phase shift is linear in freq. then slope indicates constant time lag
% positive - x1 leads x2
